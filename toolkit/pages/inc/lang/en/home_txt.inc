	Here you can test and play with different tools. These are developed 
	in the context of the research project RENDER (Reflecting Knowledge 
	Diversity). In this project, Wikimedia Deutschland is a use case 
	partner.</br>
	The tools provide an insight into the different analyses of diversity 
	in Wikipedia, which are implemented within the project. For more
