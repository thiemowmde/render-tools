$Headline = "About Us";
$Introduction = "Wikimedia Deutschland is use case partner in the RENDER project (Reflecting Knowledge Diversity). In cooperation with our partners we analyze and evaluate Wikipedia as regards diversity.";

$Text1 = "Diversity matters because it is on the one hand a result of a complete fact coverage. On the other hand, diversity implies an adequate representation of all viewpoints. Diversity is essential for an encyclopedic and neutral description. Our analyses focus upon metrics for quality in the same way they are applied to Wikipedia by human editors. We take the following criteria into account:
<ul> 
<li>Completeness</li>
<li>Timeliness</li>
<li>Objectivity</li>
</ul>";

$Text2 = "In addition we investigate the characteristics of editor interaction. For more information about the project as a whole, please visit <a href=http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RENDER>RENDER in Wikipedia</a> or <a href=http://render-project.eu>the project website</a>.
The tools on this page provide a first insight into different ways of diversity analysis, as they will be implemented in the RENDER project. In the course of the project we integrate the results in different supporting applications. Using these tools the user will be enabled to discover articles in Wikipedia needing improvement.
At the moment there are plans for two of these supporting tools:
<ul>
<li>Quality Overview Tool: this application displays analysis for every article. This tool will include the possibility to check for different metrics and provide a quick overview of an article's quality and overall condition.</li>
<li>Working List Generator: This application provides the user for a specific theme or preferred categorie lists of articles, which lacks refinement.</li>
</ul>";

$Text3 = "These supporting tools cannot and should not give an answer to the question whether an article is incomplete or biased by emphasis on a certain point of view. For that it still needs human judgement. The tools can only provide evidence for problematic articles. Articles still have to be reviewed and corrected by human beings. An automatic review of articles could save time. Saved time could be used for completion and improvement of Wikipedia. Furthermore it is possible to detect a lack of diversity with technical aid, that cannot manually done within justifiable time. All of the tools as the toolkit itself are in a continuous process of development. We are looking forward to suggestions, feedback or ideas on <a href=http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_Diskussion:RENDER>RENDER in Wikipedia</a> or by e-mail to <a href=mailto:render@wikimedia.de>render@wikimedia.de</a>.";
